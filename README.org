* Reprope

Reprope is a [[https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap][reprap]] based on ropes or cables.

Cable based robotic designs are very scalable compared to other systems.

Depending on the needs, they can be configured for high precision and torque or high speed.

When it comes to leveraging cable usage for higher torque; Arquímedes himself said it quite clearly:

"Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth"

Some people told us Arquímedes once elevated a war ship with his own force
simply by using levers, pulleys, ropes and wooden stuff.

Anyway, it was just a joke, it can be removed with a commit.

* hangprinter

The reprope extends the hangprinter, with a special focus on adding
optional features like scaling it down, allowing squared printing
volumes, allowing extra anchors, allowing extra axes or even getting
use of those extra 3 90 degree axes to get tool chaning without an
extra servo, just rotate the head 90 degrees in 3 directions as you whish.

* Firmware

For now there is only work in progress firmware extending
reprap firmware (RRF) implementation of the hangprinter:

https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware/pulls/jtimon

There may be some binaries in bin to test. But they shouldn't be
assumed to work on duet. Most of them will be compiled for the
stm32f4-wifi config on:

The copyright of this whole project belongs to the RepRope project developers.

The copyright for other free software and hardware projects this
depends on is described in theirr own projects.

This project is intended to be on free software licenses as light as
possible.

I will try to keep dependencies free.
In that sense, the hangprinter and reprap firmware seem to be
following free software licenses practices.
