* Reprope

Reprope is a [[https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap][reprap]] based on ropes or cables.

Cable based robotic designs are very scalable compared to other systems.

Depending on the needs, they can be configured for high precision and torque or high speed.

When it comes to leveraging cable usage for higher torque; Arquímedes himself said it quite clearly:

"Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth"

Some people told us Arquímedes once elevated a war ship with his own force
simply by using levers, pulleys, ropes and wooden stuff.

Anyway, it was just a joke, it can be removed with a commit.
